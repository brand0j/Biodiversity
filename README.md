# Biodiversity

## Description
The objective of this project was to build an interactive HTML page where people visiting the site can explore a dataset that catalogs the microbes found in human navels. There is a lot of information stored within this dataset, the most interesting of which were represented through varying charts throughout our webpage.

The dashboard contains:
- Dropdown to examine data from each individual by their ID-number
- Bar chart plot showing the top 10 microbial species for the selected individual
- Bubble chart displaying all the microbial species that were found with their count size representing the size of the bubble plotted on the chart itself
- Plot of washing frequency (times per week) for each individual

Below is a representation of how the webpage is presented upon launch. Some aesthetic decisions were made with the bubble chart, gauge and jumbotron to fit a more blue/earth-tone theme to provide cohesion throughout.
